    <h2> Productivity Increases But Wages Don't </h2>

    <p>In 2017 the minimum wage would be $19.30 if it grew with productivity yet the federal minimum wage stood at $7.25 an hour. As of 2020 this is still true. Many critics of the current minimum wage point to statistics like these along with statistics that show the federal minimum wage also has not grown properly with inflation or cost of living. Even over the past 11 years the federal minimum wage has stayed stagnant as it hasn't been increased since 2009. When the minimum wage was created it was intended to be a wage that would allow a worker to live comfortably, overtime it was described as a rate for teenagers and part-time workers, it's use now is seen as a "base rate" of pay, yet this base rate is so low it forces most workers to have to work overtime or multiple jobs to support themselves and their families. This has left individual states to handle setting their own minimum wages.</p>

    <h2> Where does your State stand? </h2>

    <p>States with the highest minimum wage are the District of Colombia at 15 dollars per hour followed by Washington state at $13.50. Where it gets more confusing is states that have different stipulations on the minimum wages of workers based upon the size and annual incomes of the employers. Still though, over 12 states either don't have a statewide minimum wage (using the federally mandated rate) or match the federal rate. It seems as productivity has risen, technology has risen, the cost of goods have risen, housing and rental rates have risen, and yet the minimum wage hasn't.</p>
